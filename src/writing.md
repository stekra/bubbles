Nebula: I haven't seen you in a while. You're so busy with your star adventures.

The orion nebula looks like a star from earth. It is part of Orion's sword in the constellation. But it is not a star, more like a star-fog. The ancient greeks could have never guessed.

I missed my doctor's appointment this week. I've been struggling to keep up this tasks.

I should write a letter to Mother. She deserves to know.

I won't be coming back home.

Tomorrow I'll know whether it was all worth it.

I will be much like you, soon. (pointing to star in the pic)

I love you (over picture of person, over picture of the stars)

You did it after all!

Although he's fading quickly, yesterday he actually remembered you work at the University. Though he thought you were a doctor.
You aren't a doctor, right?

He's very sick. But he's very proud of you.

I am so surprised you came after all. You told me you were so busy.
Too bad you can't stay long. It was nice seeing you.

It's lonely out here.

Would he recognize you? I don't know. Would you even recognize him?
I see a lot of him in you. k

We're not so different, you and I. There, but hidden, eclipsed.

He said he is of a different world.
Only fleeting memories of his old life.
I still remember you, for now.
I still wonder what exactly you do, and where you've gone now.

Class of 1902.
We had many ambitions.
Each one of us was a fool.
In the summer of 1903, something happened.
One of the collegues went missing.
His name was Klaus.
He was a strange man, but he was the best at drawing solar phenomena, an artist.
And  he had one friend, called Fridolin.
They seemed to be close.

note: Fridolin Phone call
...Hello?
...buzz...
Yes, this is Fridolin Barth.
- [Enquire about Klaus Klemens]
...buzz...
....Klaus Klemens...
I've successfully avoided talking about him for 20 years.
...buzz...
He was so talented...
...He was engrossed with his work at the observatorium...
The last month I knew him, he became focues on sun spots...
...It was the Eidgenössische Sternwarte in Zurich...
That's where I last saw him....
...I asked him to come home.......sleep...
...I used to come beg him to sleep every night or morning...
......But then I never saw him again....
...buzz...
...In some way he might still be 
...But not in a way that I could understand...

[Sketch:Klaus]
I am of a different world.
I have fleeting memories of my old life.
Some people, some faces.
Faint voices, warm and familiar.
Frido, you say? 
It rings a bell... Some happy bells.
