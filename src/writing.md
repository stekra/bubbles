So often I trace the lines of the image with my fingers and feel in good company.

The orion nebula looks like a star from earth. It is part of Orion's sword in the constellation. But it is not a star, more like a cloud of cosmic dust. The ancient greeks never knew.

Imagine the vastness of our ignorance.

I missed my doctor's appointment this week. I've been struggling to keep up with these tasks.

I haven't seen you in a while. You're so busy with your star adventures.

Round Round Round Round Round
Round Round Round Round Round

I should write a letter to Mother. She deserves to know.

I won't be coming back home.

Tomorrow I'll know whether it was all worth it.

I will be much like you, soon. (pointing to star in the pic)

I love you (over picture of person, over picture of the stars)

You did it after all!

Although he's fading quickly, yesterday he actually remembered you work at the University. Though he thought you were a doctor.
He's very sick. But he's very proud of you.

I am so surprised you came after all. You told me you were so busy.
Too bad you can't stay long. I'm sure he appreciated the visit, too.
Some things are gone yes, but some remain.
Like a sickle of sun before it will be fully eclipsed.

It's lonely out here.

[Study]
Would he recognize you? I don't know. Would you even recognize him?
///
You have delved deep into the secrets of your world.
You are trying to transcend mankind.
I know what you have been trying to achieve.
You are building a machine that will close the gap between you and the sky.
There is a piece that you're still missing.
You need to wait for the right moment, before the space closes.
When there is only a thin, bright sickle left of the white sun.

Ah yes. I am sorry. It is a bit strange, talking to him.
Many things have changed. Some are gone, maybe.
But he's still the same person. Because all he will eat for breakfast are his three eggs.
It's been the same for 20 years.
Do you mind going to fetch the three eggs?
---
[IMGThreeCosmicEggs]
Thank you for the eggs.
Have I met you before? I don't remember you.
Family...
That's what they all say...
But I think I am of a different world.
You seem very interesting. Very smart.
And I like your voice. It's warm.
Do you hear the bells, too?
It's a wonderful sound.

Class of 1902.
We had many ambitions.
Each one of us was a fool.
In the summer of 1903, something happened.
One of the collegues went missing.
His name was Klaus.
He was a strange man, but he was the best at drawing solar phenomena, an artist.
And  he had one friend, called Fridolin.
They seemed to be close.

note: Fridolin Phone call
...Hello?
...buzz...
Yes, this is Fridolin Barth.
- [Enquire about Klaus Klemens]
...buzz...
....Klaus Klemens...
I've successfully avoided talking about him for 20 years.
...buzz...
He was so talented...
...He was engrossed with his work at the observatorium...
The last month I knew him, he became focues on sun spots...
...It was the Eidgenössische Sternwarte in Zurich...
That's where I last saw him....
...I asked him to come home.......sleep...
...I used to come beg him to sleep every night or morning...
......But then I never saw him again....
...buzz...
...In some way he might still be 
...But not in a way that I could understand...

[Sketch:Klaus]
I am of a different world.
I have fleeting memories of my old life.
Some people, some faces.
Faint voices, warm and familiar.
Frido, you say? 
It rings a bell... Some happy bells.

It's lonely out here.

Then there will be no more gap between you and I.
I hope we can be friends, then.
